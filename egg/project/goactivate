Script to set PATH, GOPATH and shell prompt for your project. Drop this script
in your PATH. To activate environment, go in the root directory of the project
and type:

  source goactivate

This will set PATH to:

  /project/home/bin:\$PATH

And it will also set GOPATH to:

  /project/home

So that dependencies will be installed in your project home directory.
Furthermore, the shell prompt is modified so that it will show activated
project between brackets.

To deactivate the environment, type:

  deactivate

This will restore your previous PATH, GOPATH and shell prompt."
